## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words
Our dataset is about the performance of olympic athletes from the foundation of the olympics in 1896 to 2016. It includes various different types of info, including where each athlete is from, which sport they participated in, their name, which olympics they participated in, as well as if they were able to win a medal or not. As well as the type of sport, the dataset also includes which exact event the athlete competed in, and it lists the age that they were when they competed. The dataset also includes if the athlete competed in the winter olympics or the summer olympics, and lists them multiple times, both if they had consecutive appearances in the olympics, or if they competed in several different sports. The data set also includes athletes from countries that existed at the time, even if they do not exist anymore, for example the soviet union and eastern germany. Heights and weights of the athletes of when they competed are also included in the dataset. Overall it lists most information about athletes that have competed in the olympics over a span of 120 years.
