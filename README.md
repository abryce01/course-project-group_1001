## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words
We are interested in the topic of olympic athletes performance since the olympics are an event that represents our country and brings people together. The competitive aspect of the olympics is what makes it a high intensity event which is why this data is so valuable and interesting. The Olympics showcase individuals talents and the data collected is fascinating to read and analyze since it usually contains something everyone enjoys. We hope to explore the questions of, who won the most medals in a specific range of years, how would these athletes rank on a leaderboard, what country has the most gold medal athletes, and many more. The dataset we have chosen on the olympic athletes performance from 1896 to 2016 has a broad range of components and observations we can analyze and create conclusions from. This dataset gives us the ability to manipulate the data in order to create a dashboard and answer our questions we have.
